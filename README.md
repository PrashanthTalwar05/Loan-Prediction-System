# Loan-Prediction-System
The Credit Risk Analysis Model represents advancements in the domain of financial lending, offering a machine-learning framework designed to predict the creditworthiness of prospective borrowers. This tool is instrumental for banks in making informed, data-driven decisions, thereby optimizing their lending processes and minimizing potential risks.

Methodology The model's strength lies in its comprehensive analysis of various key features that distinguish a reliable loan repayer from a potential defaulter. These features include, but are not limited to:

Previous Payments: Analyzing the borrower's past payment behavior provides critical insights into their financial reliability and punctuality. Supporting Documents: The evaluation of submitted documents further augments the model's predictive accuracy by verifying the borrower's declared financial status.

In pursuit of achieving binary classification - identifying 'Loan Repayers' and 'Defaulters' - our approach involved the deployment of Decision Trees and Random Forest Classifiers. These methodologies are renowned for their efficacy in handling classification tasks and play a crucial role in the functionality of the Credit Risk Analysis Model.

The Problem here is a Binary Classifiaction and hence we are using Decision Trees and Random Forest algorithms to help us train the model
